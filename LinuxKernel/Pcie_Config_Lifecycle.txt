Configuration elements (CE<n>) related to a PCIe device can be
conceptualized as belonging to two blocks:

	Block 1 — Hardware Configuration Elements (HCEs): 
		Reside in the device’s PCI configuration space and are
		defined by the PCIe specification.

	Block 2 — Driver Configuration Elements (DCEs): 
		Represent driver-defined tunables, features, or runtime
		parameters, typically surfaced via sysfs or managed internally
		within the driver.

Lifecycle of Hardware Configuration Elements (HCEs)

	The state of a PCIe device’s HCEs evolves through several stages:

	Initialization:
		Initially set by the platform firmware (BIOS/UEFI) during early
		system boot.

	Device Firmware Overrides:
		May be modified by firmware resident on the device itself — commonly
		embedded in a ROM accessible via the Expansion ROM BAR. This device
		local firmware is executed by the platform firmware and may configure
		standard or vendor-specific registers within the PCIe configuration space.

	Kernel Overrides:
		Updated by the Linux kernel during PCIe enumeration. This phase may
		override or reprogram configuration space fields to ensure correct
		operation, allocate resources, enable features like bus mastering
		or disable unwanted capabilities.

	Userspace Overrides:
		Additional modifications may be triggered by udev rules, which can
		invoke helper tools (e.g., setpci) to modify specific configuration
		registers exposed through HCEs.

	After kernel enumeration, it is common to find files under sysfs that
	expose one or more HCEs for userspace access. These files are surfaced
	by the PCI subsystem during device discovery. Importantly, these files
	are informationally equivalent to the PCI configuration space — they
	mirror the hardware state and do not represent new or independent values.

Lifecycle of Driver Configuration Elements (DCEs)

	Driver Configuration Elements (DCEs) are software defined values associated
	with the device driver rather than the hardware. Unlike HCEs, which reside
	in PCI config space, DCEs are maintained within the driver’s internal
	structures and may reflect tunable parameters, operational modes, performance
	thresholds, or runtime control points. These are commonly exposed via sysfs,
	debugfs, procfs, or module_param interfaces, enabling interaction with
	userspace tools without requiring direct hardware manipulation.

	DCEs are initialized and updated in the following phases:

	Initialization:
		DCEs with simple initial values (e.g., int foo = 42;) are initialized at
		module load time, before module_init() is invoked. DCEs requiring code
		execution (e.g., to compute a value dynamically) must be initialized after
		the call to module_init(), either within that function or from routines
		invoked thereafter.

	Driver Overrides (Phase 1):
		During module loading, drivers may override default DCE values using module
		parameters passed via modprobe or the kernel command line. In some cases,
		drivers may also modify associated HCEs (via pci_write_config_*()) to ensure
		that hardware state and its sysfs representation remain in sync.

		@note: Like the PCI subsystem, drivers often create sysfs files that expose
		values from both HCE and DCE blocks.

	Userspace Overrides (Phase 1):
		Additional updates may be performed via udev rules that match the device
		and execute helper scripts or utilities such as setpci, ethtool, or driver
		specific commands. These may modify values in either HCE or DCE blocks
		depending on implementation.

	Userspace Overrides (Phase 2):
		After driver binding, userspace can write directly to sysfs files created
		by the driver. These files offer fine-grained control over DCEs and, where
		supported, may also update associated HCEs via driver-controlled logic.

The above seems to suggest limited configuration opportunity which is very far
from the actual way system are deployed in real world. The procedures users
follow in configuring systems engage heavily services from the userspace.

Following is a brief description of these:
    udev - userspace device manager
    systemd - system and service manager
    Module Management Tools e.g., ethtool, nvme-cli, etc

For example it is possible for udev to subscribe to events such as
device detection and enumeration. So upon device enumeration, one
can trigger execution of a tool or a script to configure the device
appropriately.

In a similar manner one can engage a module specific management tool
to configure a specific device. Depending upon implementation, it
could subscribe to events or use other mechanisms to execute user
specified configuration bindings.

In fact much of the configuration of devices on various systems is
accomplished through this userspace services / mechanisms.
