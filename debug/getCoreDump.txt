Is it possible to collect a core dump of the segmentation fault.

Run following commands to enable:

// Core files should be available in /tmp folder
ulimit -c unlimited
sysctl -w kernel.core_pattern=/tmp/core_%e_%p
Run the workload
Get its process Id:  "ps -ef | grep <workloadName>"

When a hang occurs i.e. app is stuck and has not core dumped
Issue the bash command: "gcore <process-id>"

Assumption is workload can be run as ONE process and get the segmentation fault.
In case it needs at least TWO processes then user should get process Id for both
processes and issue gcore command for both processes.

Core files take  up a large amount space. A test core file for rocm-bandwidth-test was about 4.5 GB.
