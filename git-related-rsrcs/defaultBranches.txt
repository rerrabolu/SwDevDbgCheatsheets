When working with a group of repositories sometimes we need to reset
the branches of various repos to their default one. For example repo
forest has three repos R1, R2 and R3 and each repo has three branches
B1, B2, B3. The configuration file that sets up the workspace defines
B1 as default for R1, B2 for R2 and B3 for R3. This default configuration
is explained as follows: R1::B1, R2::B2, R3::B3.

Due to one or more reasons the state of the repo forest changes from its
default condition to something as follows: R1::B3, R2::B1, R3::B1

The following command should reset the repo forest to its default configuation

  <shell-prompt> "query repo forest config"
    Repo-Forest-Config: R1::B3, R2::B1, R3::B1
  
  <shell-prompt> repo sync -d
  
  <shell-prompt> "query repo forest config"
    Repo-Forest-Config: R1::B1, R2::B2, R3::B3
