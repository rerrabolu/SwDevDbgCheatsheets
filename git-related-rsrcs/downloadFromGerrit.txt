#######################################

  Execute the commands provided on gerrit for "CHECKOUT"
  Create a new branch that contains the downloaded patch
  
    // URL is obtained from gerrit. Rest are standard commands
   <shell-prompt> git fetch URL-FOR-THE-PATCH

Download the patch as a new commit into local branch:
#####################################################

  Assume you have a branch called "WorkingBranch" and has one or
  more changes related to a feature. You wish to pull in changes
  from another branch to be added to your working branch. You can
  do the following:
  
    // URL is obtained from gerrit. Rest are standard commands
   <shell-prompt> git checkout <WorkingBranch>
   <shell-prompt> git fetch URL-FOR-THE-PATCH
   <shell-prompt> git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD

  If there are any code conflicts resolve them and ask
  git to accept resolution

    // Assume there are conflicts. If so resolve them manually
    // Then run the following command
   <shell-prompt> git cherry-pick --continue
