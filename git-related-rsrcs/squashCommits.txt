Procedure to Squash commits:

Follow these steps if you have to merge multiple commits into one
Let's say you made commits A,B,C on a branch. Lets say A is the
oldest and C is the youngest. Squashing will lead to branch having
commit A with all of the changes from B and C being brought in.
During this process one can update the commit message so that it
is reflective of the full work being done.

## Query the number of commit messages
<shell-prompt> git log
 commit-A
  Message from commit-A
 commit-B
  Message from commit-B
 commit-C
  Message from commit-C
 commit-D
  Message from commit-D
 commit-E
  Message from commit-E

## You want to squash top 3 commits - A,B,C
## Run rebase command as follows
<shell-prompt> git rebase -i HEAD~3

  In the edit window you will see the following

   pick commit-C
   pick commit-B
   pick commit-A

  Change it to following
  
   pick commit-C
   squash commit-B
   squash commit-A
